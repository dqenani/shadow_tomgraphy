# Classical Shadow Tomography
This repository contains an analysis of classical shadow tomography. It contains the shadow creation code, originally published by Huang et al. which was used in tandem with simulated systems to perform calculations and benchmarks. Additionally it contains the Qiskit Classical Shadow code (by @dqenani) which was based off the original work from Huang et al. and the pennylane implementation of classical shadows. Qiskit Classical Shadow is optimized to the native qiskit gatesets and can be used in conjunction with general quantum programs created in Qiskit. There are two working versions, one which takes advatange of the Pauli group, the other takes advatange of the Clifford group (there are specfic use cases to exploit each of the versions). Code performing a comparison between Qiskit Classical Shadows and Pennylane Classical Shadows is included.
